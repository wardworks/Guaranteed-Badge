Extensive css practice with shapes

I am learning and practicing css, and thought it would be helpful practice to manipulate and create this extensive 
collection of shapes. I'm certain it's not as smoothly done as it could have been, and I know I could have created a 
vector in 1/10 of the time, but as I mentioned, practice!

Any feedback is welcome!
